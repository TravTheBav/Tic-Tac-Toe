# Tic-Tac-Toe
A version of Tic Tac Toe for the command line; made with Ruby! 

First player to get a matching row, column, or diagonal wins.
On your turn, input where you want to place your X or O using a coordinate system

Board coordinates are mapped like so:

    0   1   2
0   _ | _ | _
1   _ | _ | _
2   _ | _ | _

So for example, if you want to put your mark in the middle of the board, enter 1,1 when prompted

Example:

    Enter a board position (e.g. 0,1):
    1,1

    _ | _ | _
    _ | X | _
    _ | _ | _
